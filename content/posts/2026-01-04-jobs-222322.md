In October 2023, iRacing Studios made waves in the gaming community with the release of NASCAR 25, the first multi-platform NASCAR console game since 2021. This new title not only revitalizes the NASCAR gaming experience but also boasts one of the largest selections of base paint schemes seen in recent years. With the inclusion of drivers from the three NASCAR National Series and the ARCA Menards Series, players are treated to a diverse array of paint schemes that enhance the visual appeal of the game.

While some fan-favorite sponsors like Red Bull make a long-awaited return, the game does have its share of exclusions, such as Monster Energy and certain alcoholic beverage sponsors. This mix of inclusions and exclusions provides a unique perspective on the evolving landscape of NASCAR sponsorships and their representation in gaming. As fans dive into the game, they will undoubtedly appreciate the nostalgia of seeing classic paint schemes alongside new designs.

Looking ahead, it will be interesting to see how iRacing continues to evolve its offerings and whether future updates will address the gaps in sponsorship representation. What are your thoughts on the current selection of paint schemes? Will they satisfy the nostalgia of long-time fans while attracting new players to the NASCAR gaming scene?
