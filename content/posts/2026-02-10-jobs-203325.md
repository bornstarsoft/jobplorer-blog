The job market is showing signs of revival, with a recent survey revealing that 73.4% of domestic companies in South Korea plan to hire new graduates this year. This marks a significant increase in hiring intentions compared to previous years, particularly as the world transitions out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from HR tech firm Incruit indicate a growing optimism among employers, suggesting that the doors to employment are finally opening again.

Among large corporations, the hiring outlook is even more promising, with 87.3% confirming their recruitment plans, a staggering 33.3% increase from last year. Mid-sized companies are also on board, with 81.1% planning to hire, reflecting a robust recovery in the job market. However, small businesses lag slightly behind, with only 69.8% indicating hiring intentions, showing a more cautious approach.

As we move further into 2023, the landscape of employment is evolving, and it will be interesting to see how these trends unfold. Will this renewed enthusiasm for hiring translate into a more competitive job market for graduates? Only time will tell.
