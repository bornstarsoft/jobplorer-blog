The recent report from the Jeollabuk-do Research Institute highlights a concerning trend: the youth population in Jeollabuk-do is projected to halve by 2050. Despite some improvements in employment rates, factors such as income stagnation, housing challenges, and overall quality of life are driving young people away from the region. This trend is particularly pronounced among women and those in their twenties, raising alarms about the future workforce and community vitality.

While the employment rate for young people in Jeollabuk-do is expected to rise to 60.8% by 2024, the average monthly wage remains at 2.34 million won, only 87% of the national average. This discrepancy indicates that mere job availability is insufficient for ensuring a stable and fulfilling life for the youth. The high rates of unmarried individuals and the increasing age of first marriages further illustrate the difficulties young people face in achieving independence and stability.

Moreover, mental health concerns are on the rise, particularly among young women and job seekers, with significant rates of depression and burnout reported. The research suggests that a comprehensive approach is needed, focusing not only on economic conditions but also on emotional well-being and social connections. As we look to the future, its crucial to consider what measures can be taken to create an environment where young people want to stay and thrive in Jeollabuk-do. Will we see a shift in policy that addresses these multifaceted challenges?
