In a remarkable achievement, Busan has surpassed 1 million regular workers, marking a historic milestone in the city's employment landscape. According to the latest data from the National Statistical Office, as of June 2025, the number of regular workers in Busan reached 1,003,000, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. This growth not only sets a record for the city but also positions Busan as a leader among South Korea's metropolitan areas in terms of employment growth.

This significant increase in the workforce is attributed to strategic initiatives implemented by the local government, including industrial restructuring and investment attraction, which have fostered a more robust job market. Furthermore, the city has been proactive in collaborating with local businesses to share successes and enhance employment opportunities, as highlighted in a recent meeting with the Busan Chamber of Commerce.

Looking ahead, Busan's selection as the host city for the 2026 World Heritage Committee further underscores its growing significance on the global stage. As the city continues to innovate and adapt, one can't help but wonder how these developments will shape the future of employment and economic growth in Busan and beyond.
