In a significant move to enhance educational outcomes, the Education and Training Department is proposing to strengthen admission criteria based on employment rates. This initiative aims to prohibit the increase of enrollment in institutions where graduate employment rates fall below 70%. By shifting the focus from mere input metrics to output-based evaluations, this policy seeks to create a tighter link between admission rates and educational success.

This approach reflects a growing recognition that the effectiveness of educational programs should be measured not just by the number of students admitted but by their subsequent success in the job market. As educational institutions adapt to these new standards, the implications for both students and educators could be profound, potentially reshaping the landscape of higher education.

As we look to the future, how will these changes influence the choices of prospective students and the strategies of educational institutions?
