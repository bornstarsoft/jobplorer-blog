In a remarkable achievement, Daedong Hospital in Busan has been awarded the highest rating, S-grade, in the 2025 Integrated Nursing and Care Services Evaluation conducted by the National Health Insurance Corporation. This accolade places Daedong Hospital among the top 5% of healthcare institutions in South Korea, reflecting its commitment to quality patient care and safety.

The evaluation assessed 709 medical institutions, focusing on various criteria such as participation rates in integrated services, the ratio of experienced nurses, completion rates of nursing education, and the availability of safety equipment. Daedong Hospital not only secured the S-grade but also ranked fifth nationally, demonstrating consistent excellence as it achieved the same rating last year.

Nursing Director Jeong Mi-jin emphasized that this success is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the staff, who strive to create a safe and supportive environment for patients. As healthcare continues to evolve, the emphasis on integrated services will likely play a crucial role in enhancing patient trust and satisfaction. How will other hospitals rise to meet these standards in the future?
