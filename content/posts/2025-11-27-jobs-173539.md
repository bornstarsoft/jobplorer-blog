In South Korea, the plight of the elderly, particularly those with disabilities, is becoming increasingly dire. With a staggering unemployment rate four times higher than their non-disabled counterparts and a poverty rate that is three times the OECD average, the elderly population is facing a crisis that demands immediate attention. The reliance on labor for survival, coupled with inadequate pension systems, underscores a systemic failure that leaves many vulnerable.

The statistics reveal a grim reality: 31.6% of elderly individuals with disabilities live alone, and many report unmet medical needs due to financial constraints or lack of companionship. This situation is exacerbated by the low uptake of housing pension schemes, which could provide much-needed financial support. Experts argue that a comprehensive redesign of the retirement income safety net is essential to address these multifaceted challenges.

As we look to the future, it's crucial to consider how we can better support our aging population. What innovative solutions can we implement to ensure that our elderly citizens, especially those with disabilities, receive the care and support they need? The time for action is now, and it's up to us to advocate for change.
