Dunamu, the company behind Upbit and Securities Plus, is set to bolster its technical capabilities by hiring over 50 developers by January next year. This strategic move aims to enhance the technology behind its core services and adapt to regulatory changes, particularly focusing on key projects like the Web3 infrastructure brand GIWA and Upbit Custody for corporate clients.

The recruitment drive will cover various development roles, including backend, frontend, infrastructure, and blockchain, emphasizing the need for experienced professionals. The hiring process will consist of multiple stages, ensuring that only the best candidates join this tech-centric organization, which has been strengthening its technological infrastructure since 2020, particularly in areas like anti-money laundering (AML) and data management.

Dunamu's commitment to innovation in finance and blockchain underscores its belief that technology is the cornerstone of competitive advantage. As they continue to create an environment where developers can lead new initiatives and grow, one can't help but wonder how this influx of talent will shape the future of the fintech landscape.
