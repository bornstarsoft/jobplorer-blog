In a progressive move to enhance youth employment opportunities, Daegu's Seo-gu district has introduced two innovative programs aimed at supporting job seekers aged 19 to 39. The initiatives include a resume photo support service and an AI mock interview program, designed to equip young individuals with the necessary tools to succeed in a competitive job market.

The resume photo support service offers professional photography, Photoshop editing, and printing services, ensuring that applicants present themselves in the best possible light. Meanwhile, the AI mock interview program, hosted at the Youth Center, provides personalized coaching, including resume feedback and English conversation practice. These tailored programs reflect a growing recognition of the challenges faced by young job seekers today.

As the job market continues to evolve, initiatives like these not only provide practical assistance but also foster confidence among youth preparing for their careers. Will such innovative approaches become a standard in other regions as well?
