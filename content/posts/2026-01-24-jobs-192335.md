The integration of robotics in manufacturing is proving to be a game-changer, not just for productivity but also for employment and wages. Contrary to fears that robots will replace human jobs, recent research from the Korea Labor Institute indicates that the introduction of humanoid robots in the manufacturing sector has led to an increase in employment rates and higher wages for skilled workers. Specifically, from 2005 to 2020, the number of robots per 1,000 workers increased by 6.6, resulting in a 0.6% rise in manufacturing employment and a 2.5% increase in monthly wages for skilled laborers.

Moreover, the report highlights that about 83% of the new jobs created in the manufacturing sector due to robotics are permanent positions, suggesting a significant improvement in job quality. The positive ripple effects of robotics extend beyond manufacturing, positively impacting non-manufacturing employment as well. This phenomenon underscores the notion that rather than displacing workers, robots enhance productivity and create new job opportunities.

As we look to the future, the challenge will be to balance technological advancement with workforce stability. How can industries ensure that the benefits of robotics are shared broadly among workers?
