T'way Airlines is making significant strides in enhancing its corporate value by focusing on youth employment support and improving employee welfare. The airline's initiative, the '2025 Future Tomorrow Work Experience Program,' aims to provide practical training opportunities for around 144 young individuals this year. By expanding the program to include various airports and departments, T'way is not only facilitating career exploration for the youth but also demonstrating a commitment to social responsibility.

In addition to its youth initiatives, T'way Airlines is actively promoting employee welfare through various summer events, such as providing beverage gift cards and snacks for overseas staff. The introduction of 'Cool-biz' summer uniforms since 2018 further highlights the company's dedication to creating a comfortable work environment. A representative emphasized that supporting employees and youth is integral to sustainable corporate growth.

T'way Airlines' approach serves as a compelling example of how businesses can intertwine social responsibility with talent development. As we look to the future, how can other companies adopt similar strategies to foster a more sustainable and supportive work culture?
