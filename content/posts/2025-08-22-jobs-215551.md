Cheonan City has achieved a remarkable employment rate of 69.4% in the first half of this year, marking the highest level since the statistics began in 2017. This achievement reflects the citys comprehensive employment policies aimed at supporting various age groups, particularly the elderly, through initiatives like the Senior Companion Convenience Store.

The newly opened second store in the Senior Companion program not only provides jobs for seniors but also ensures a sustainable income model through its operations. With 10 seniors aged 60 and above working in shifts, this initiative exemplifies how targeted job creation can enhance the quality of life for older adults while contributing to the local economy. As Cheonan continues to focus on job creation and industry growth, it raises an important question: how can other cities adopt similar strategies to support their aging populations?
