The cybersecurity industry is facing a significant shift as companies increasingly prefer experienced professionals over fresh graduates. This trend is primarily driven by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the pressing need for immediate expertise in a field that is constantly evolving. Newcomers often find it challenging to secure positions, as employers are looking for candidates who can hit the ground running, especially in high-stakes environments where the cost of errors can be substantial.

Recent statistics from the Korea Information Security Industry Association (KISIA) highlight this growing preference. In 2024, the number of experienced hires outnumbered entry-level positions significantly, with 5,170 experienced roles compared to just 2,654 for newcomers. This marks a stark contrast to previous years, where entry-level roles were more prevalent. The shift indicates a tightening job market for fresh graduates, who now face an uphill battle in gaining relevant experience.

As the cybersecurity landscape becomes more complex, the reliance on AI tools for threat detection and response further complicates the hiring dynamics. Companies are less inclined to invest time in training new employees when they can opt for seasoned professionals who already possess the necessary skills. This raises an important question: how can aspiring cybersecurity professionals gain the experience needed to break into this competitive field?
