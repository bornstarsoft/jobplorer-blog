In the face of economic downturns, Daejeon is witnessing a significant increase in temporary workers and solo entrepreneurs, raising concerns about the quality of job security in the region. Recent reports indicate that while the overall employment rate has risen, the growth is primarily driven by temporary positions, which are often less stable and more vulnerable to economic fluctuations.

The data reveals that the number of temporary workers has surged by 17.4%, while traditional full-time positions have seen a decline. This shift towards less secure employment is mirrored in the rise of solo entrepreneurs, with a notable 22.8% increase in self-employed individuals without employees. This trend highlights a growing reliance on precarious work arrangements, which may not provide the same benefits and protections as stable employment.

As we navigate these changes, it becomes increasingly clear that policy interventions are needed to enhance job quality and security. What strategies can be implemented to support workers in this evolving landscape, ensuring that economic recovery does not come at the cost of job stability?
