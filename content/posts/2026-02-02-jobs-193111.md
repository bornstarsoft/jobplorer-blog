In Jeju, South Korea, a striking paradox exists: the elderly population boasts the highest employment rate in the country, yet their wages remain alarmingly low. This phenomenon, often referred to as 'working poverty,' highlights a systemic issue where older adults are compelled to work not out of choice, but necessity. The stark reality is that many seniors find themselves in low-paying jobs, primarily in agriculture and manual labor, which do not provide adequate financial support for a dignified life.

Recent discussions among policymakers and researchers have shed light on this troubling trend. For instance, over 70% of employed seniors in Jeju cite economic reasons for their work, indicating that their participation in the labor force is driven by survival rather than voluntary engagement. Moreover, the average monthly income for elderly workers in Jeju lags significantly behind the national average, exacerbating their financial struggles.

To address these challenges, experts are calling for innovative job creation strategies that go beyond traditional public work programs. Suggestions include developing specialized services like 'dementia money' management and grocery delivery for seniors in rural areas, which could enhance job quality and economic stability. As we look to the future, the question remains: how can we create a labor market that not only employs our elderly population but also values their contributions and ensures their financial security?
