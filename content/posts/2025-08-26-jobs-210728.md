Korea Southern Power's recent initiative, the 'NCS Dream Open Campus,' is making waves in the realm of youth employment support. Launched to enhance the job readiness of local youth in Busan, this program offers specialized training based on the National Competency Standards (NCS), helping participants gain practical insights into the energy sector and the public job market.

Over two months, 34 university students and graduates engaged in a curriculum that included expert lectures, online courses, and field trips to the Busan Bitdream Headquarters. The program not only provided theoretical knowledge but also simulated real-world hiring processes through mock exams and interviews, ensuring participants were well-prepared for their future careers.

As the program continues to receive positive feedback, Korea Southern Power plans to make this initiative an annual event, reaffirming its commitment to nurturing local talent and contributing to social value. How can similar programs be implemented globally to bridge the gap between education and employment for youth?
