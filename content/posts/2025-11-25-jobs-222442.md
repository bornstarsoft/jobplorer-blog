Recent findings from Ulsan reveal a stark gender gap in work-life balance, highlighting significant disparities in employment rates, work hours, and stress levels between men and women. According to the Southeast Regional Statistics Office, the employment rate for men stands at 70.2%, while for women, it is only 48.6%. This 21.6 percentage point difference underscores the ongoing challenges women face in achieving equal participation in the workforce.

Moreover, the data indicates that men work longer hours on average, clocking in 7 hours and 20 minutes on weekdays compared to womens 5 hours and 52 minutes. Interestingly, while women report higher satisfaction with workplace culture regarding work-family balance, they also bear a heavier burden in household management, spending significantly more time on domestic tasks.

As we reflect on these findings, it raises important questions about how we can foster a more equitable work environment. What steps can be taken to bridge this gap and ensure that both men and women can enjoy a fulfilling work-life balance?
