In a remarkable achievement, Gyeongnam Province has recorded an employment rate of 64.1% in September 2025, surpassing the national average of 63.7%. This milestone not only marks the highest employment rate since statistics began but also reflects a significant 2.0 percentage point increase compared to the same month last year.

The statistics released by the Korean Statistical Office highlight a robust job market, particularly in the manufacturing and service sectors. With an increase of 32,000 jobs in manufacturing alone, Gyeongnam is witnessing a resurgence in employment opportunities, which is crucial for the local economy. Furthermore, the construction industry has shown consistent growth, adding 13,000 jobs year-over-year.

As Gyeongnam's economy continues to thrive despite external uncertainties, the local government is committed to enhancing job creation strategies tailored for both youth and middle-aged workers. This proactive approach aims to foster a resilient employment ecosystem that benefits all residents. How will Gyeongnam maintain this momentum in the coming months?
