The Cheongju Chamber of Commerce recently held a New Year's gathering, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing the Chungbuk economy. With over 400 attendees, including prominent local leaders, the event highlighted the region's impressive economic indicators from the previous year, such as GRDP growth and export rates. Chairman Cha Tae-hwan expressed a bold vision for 2026, aiming to leverage past successes as a springboard for even greater economic achievements.
