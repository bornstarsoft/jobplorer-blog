The alarming rise in the number of young people disengaged from the workforce highlights a pressing issue: K-shaped polarization in employment. Recent statistics reveal that one in twenty young individuals in their twenties has exited the job market, a trend that underscores the urgent need for tailored employment strategies by governments worldwide.

Despite an overall increase in employment rates, the youth demographic, particularly those aged 15 to 29, has seen a decline in job participation. This paradox is largely attributed to a mismatch between the aspirations of young job seekers and the available opportunities, particularly in the private sector. With many young people aiming for positions in major metropolitan corporations, local small businesses struggle to fill vacancies, exacerbating the divide.

As AI technology rapidly transforms industries, the demand for jobs is shifting, leaving many young individuals feeling disillusioned and opting out of the job search altogether. This trend not only affects their economic stability but also poses long-term implications for the workforce. How can we bridge this gap and create a more inclusive job market for the youth?
