South Korea's recent analysis reveals that the nation ranks 10th globally in quantum computing and 12th in quantum communication and sensing. This insight, shared during the 22nd Future Talent Special Committee meeting, underscores the competitive landscape in which countries like China and the U.S. dominate research and development in these critical technologies. The South Korean government is keenly aware of the need to bolster its position in the global talent pool, particularly as it relates to emerging technologies.

The Ministry of Science and ICT's efforts to create a global talent map for the quantum sector highlight the strategic importance of attracting and retaining top researchers. With the increasing demand for skilled professionals in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum technologies, South Korea aims to adapt its educational and policy frameworks to better meet industry needs. As AI continues to evolve, the demand for experienced professionals has surged, reflecting a broader trend in technology sectors worldwide.

Looking ahead, South Korea's commitment to expanding its talent development initiatives in both quantum and AI fields will be crucial. How can the nation leverage its strengths to foster innovation and compete on the global stage?
