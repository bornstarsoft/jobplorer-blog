In 2023, a significant trend has emerged in the hiring landscape of major companies in South Korea, with healthcare, nursing, and welfare roles dominating new employee recruitment. According to a recent analysis by HR tech firm Incruit, these sectors accounted for 15.0% of all job postings for regular positions from January to September, reflecting a growing emphasis on safety and health management in the workplace.

This shift can be attributed to the strengthened enforcement of the Serious Accident Punishment Act, prompting companies to actively seek safety and health managers to enhance workplace safety. Following healthcare roles, production, maintenance, and labor positions made up 12.2% of the hiring landscape, indicating ongoing labor shortages in certain manufacturing sectors.

Interestingly, traditional roles in management, human resources, and administration also maintained a strong presence at 10.8%. However, creative fields like design and media saw the lowest demand, each representing only 0.7% of the total job postings. As we look ahead, it raises the question: how will these trends evolve in response to ongoing changes in the economy and workforce needs?
