In October, South Korea saw a notable increase in employment, with 193,000 more jobs compared to the same month last year. However, the youth employment rate continues to struggle, marking 18 consecutive months of decline. This juxtaposition highlights a growing concern about job security, particularly among younger demographics.

The service sector has shown significant job growth, particularly in health and social services, arts, and retail. Yet, traditional sectors like agriculture, construction, and manufacturing have faced declines, raising questions about the sustainability of these job gains. Notably, the number of individuals who reported being inactive in the job market has surged, particularly among those in their 30s, reaching levels not seen in over two decades.

As we reflect on these trends, it becomes clear that while some sectors are thriving, the overall job market remains precarious, especially for younger workers. What strategies can be implemented to boost youth employment and ensure a more stable job market for all?
