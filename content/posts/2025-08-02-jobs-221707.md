Gangneung, a city in South Korea, has emerged as a beacon of economic revitalization, achieving a remarkable employment rate of 68.7% and winning the national job creation award for three consecutive years. This success is largely attributed to innovative policies like the local currency, Gangneung Pay, which has become a crucial platform for boosting local consumption and supporting small businesses.

The city is not just focusing on immediate economic growth; it is also laying the groundwork for sustainable development by fostering the natural bio-industry as a key growth sector. With plans to establish a national industrial complex and innovation centers, Gangneung aims to become the leading hub for natural bio-resources in South Korea. This strategic focus on specialized industries, coupled with initiatives to create a business-friendly environment, positions Gangneung as an attractive destination for both companies and young professionals.

As Gangneung continues to evolve into a city where businesses thrive and young people want to stay, it raises an important question: how can other cities learn from Gangneung's approach to create their own sustainable economic ecosystems?
