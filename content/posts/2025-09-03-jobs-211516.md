Ulsan Ulju-gun has made headlines by achieving an impressive employment rate of 66.5% for the 15-64 age group, the highest among the five districts in Ulsan. This remarkable statistic reflects not just a recovery but a significant growth in the local economy, with the number of employed individuals rising to 120,000, a notable increase from the previous year.

The data from the Korean Statistical Office highlights a particularly strong performance in the core employment age group of 30-49, where the employment rate surpassed 80%. Additionally, the youth employment rate has also seen a positive trend, climbing from 32.3% to 35.2%. This upward trajectory indicates a robust economic environment that is fostering job creation across various demographics, including women, whose participation rates have reached record highs.

As Ulju-gun continues to strengthen its labor market, it raises an important question: what strategies can other regions adopt to replicate this success? The focus on stable employment and the increase in female workforce participation could serve as a model for economic development across South Korea and beyond.
