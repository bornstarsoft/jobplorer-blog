As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes an integral part of recruitment processes, job seekers are resorting to clever tricks to outsmart these systems. Reports indicate that candidates are embedding hidden commands in their resumes to manipulate AI filters, a practice that is gaining traction across social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit. This phenomenon, known as 'White Fonting', involves writing invisible text that instructs AI to rank them higher, raising ethical questions about the integrity of the hiring process.

The implications of this trend are significant. With approximately 90% of companies worldwide using AI to filter applications, candidates are increasingly feeling pressured to game the system. For instance, one graduate shared that after submitting a traditional resume with little success, he received multiple interview offers after embedding AI commands in his application. This raises a critical concern: as job seekers and employers engage in a 'cat-and-mouse' game, are we undermining the very purpose of recruitment?

As we move forward, it will be essential to address the ethical dilemmas posed by AI in hiring. Will companies adapt their systems to counter these tactics, or will we see a continued escalation in the arms race between job seekers and AI technologies?
