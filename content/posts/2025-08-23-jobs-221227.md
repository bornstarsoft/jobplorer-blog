Gunsan's employment rate has hit a concerning low of 59.7%, marking the lowest in the province and highlighting significant economic challenges. This figure is not just a number; it represents the struggles of a community facing a staggering 39.2% of its population classified as non-economically active, the highest in the region. 

The stark contrast between Gunsan and the highest employment rate in Muju County, which stands at 76.2%, raises questions about the local economy's resilience and the factors contributing to such disparities. As businesses evolve and technology reshapes job markets, understanding these dynamics becomes crucial for policymakers and residents alike. 

With the rise in unemployment and non-active economic participants, what steps can be taken to revitalize the job market in Gunsan? The future of employment in this city may depend on innovative solutions and community engagement.
