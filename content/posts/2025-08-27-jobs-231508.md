Ongjin-gun has recently made headlines by achieving the highest employment rate among seven special metropolitan cities and districts, hitting an impressive 76.7% for the first half of 2025. This achievement not only places Ongjin-gun third nationally but also highlights the region's commitment to economic recovery and job creation.

The local government, led by Mayor Moon Kyung-bok, has actively worked to provide diverse public employment opportunities, ensuring that residents can maintain their livelihoods amidst economic challenges. The statistics released by the Korean Statistical Office reflect a 0.8 percentage point increase compared to the previous year, showcasing the effectiveness of these initiatives.

As we look to the future, Ongjin-gun's approach to fostering quality job opportunities could serve as a blueprint for other regions facing economic difficulties. How can other local governments learn from Ongjin-gun's success to bolster their own employment rates and economic resilience?
