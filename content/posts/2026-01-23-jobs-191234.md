The Jeonju International Film Festival (JIFF) is not just a celebration of cinema; it's an opportunity for passionate individuals to engage with the film community as volunteers. Known as 'Jipjigi', these volunteers play a crucial role in the festival's success, from assisting with events to participating in educational programs. If youre over 18 and residing in South Korea, this could be your chance to immerse yourself in the world of film while making valuable connections.

The application process runs from February 5 to March 4, 2026, with various training sessions scheduled leading up to the festival. Participants will receive uniforms, activity certificates, and even transportation allowances for those traveling from outside Jeonbuk Province. This is a fantastic way to gain hands-on experience in event management and film production, all while enjoying the vibrant atmosphere of the festival.

As the festival approaches, consider how volunteering can enrich your understanding of cinema and community engagement. Will you take the leap and join the ranks of dedicated film enthusiasts at JIFF?
