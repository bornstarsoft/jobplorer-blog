The latest employment statistics reveal a significant shift in the workforce dynamics, particularly among married women. According to the National Data Agency's report, the employment rate for married women aged 15-54 has reached an all-time high of 67.3%, a clear indication that policies aimed at supporting working mothers are making a substantial impact. This increase is not just a number; it reflects changing societal norms and the growing recognition of women's contributions to the economy.

Interestingly, the proportion of women experiencing career interruptions, often referred to as "career-break women" (), has dropped to its lowest level since records began. This decline, particularly among those with children under 18, suggests that more women are successfully balancing work and family life. The data shows that 21.3% of married women with children under 18 are now facing career interruptions, down from previous years, highlighting a positive trend towards sustained employment.

As we look to the future, the question remains: how can we continue to support this momentum? With the right policies and societal support, we can further empower women in the workforce, ensuring that the trend of increasing employment among working mothers not only continues but thrives.
