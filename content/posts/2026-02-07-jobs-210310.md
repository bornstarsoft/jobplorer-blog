Choi Min-jung, the daughter of SK Group Chairman Choi Tae-won, is making waves in the tech world with her healthcare startup, Integral Health. Recently, the company posted a job listing for an AI Product Engineer, signaling its intention to expand its operations in South Korea and leverage local talent in artificial intelligence to enhance mental health services. Founded in 2024, Integral Health aims to simplify access to mental health care through AI and data-driven technologies.

The recruitment process will allow for a hybrid work model, combining remote and in-person work in Seoul. The selected candidates will collaborate with product and clinical teams to develop solutions using the latest large language models (LLMs), focusing on UI/UX design and documentation. Choi Min-jung has expressed her commitment to attracting top talent, even promising a life-changing steak for those who help in the recruitment process.

As Integral Health transitions its base from San Francisco to Brooklyn, New York, this move reflects a broader strategy to tap into the global market, including South Korea. With her unique background and proactive approach, Choi Min-jung is positioning herself as a notable figure in the startup ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of combining technology with mental health care. What does this mean for the future of mental health services worldwide?
